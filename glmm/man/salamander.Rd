\title{Salamander mating data set from McCullagh and Nelder (1989)}
\description{This data set presents the outcome of an experiment  conducted at the University of Chicago in 1986 to study interbreeding between populations of mountain dusky salamanders (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989, Section 14.5).}

\usage{data(salamander)}
\format{
  A data frame with the following columns:

   \describe{
\item{Mate}{Whether the salamanders mated (1) or did not mate (0).}
\item{Cross}{Cross between female and male type. A factor with four levels: \code{R/R},\code{R/W},\code{W/R}, and \code{W/W}. The type of the female salamander is listed first and the male is listed second. Rough Butt is represented by R and White Side is represented by W. For example, \code{Cross=W/R} indicates a White Side female was crossed with a Rough Butt male.}
\item{Male}{Identification number of the male salamander. A factor.}
\item{Female}{Identification number of the female salamander. A factor.}
