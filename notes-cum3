The complaint about line 16 character 13 of cum3.c is about ntrials[i]
and i goes from 0 to leneta in this statement.
So we need argument 4 ntrials to be at least the dereference of argument 2 neta
    that is, we need ntrials[i] to work when 0 <= i < neta[0]
If we look in tests/binomfamtest.R the calls to cum3 seem OK
If we look in tests/cfamilies.R the second call to cum3 is clearly bogus
    length(eta) = 3, neta = length(eta), but ntrials = as.integer(1)
